* chest pain type

0 --> risk

1 --> borderline

2 --> borderline

3 --> risk






* cholestrol levels

cholestrol < 200  -->  normal
between 200 and 239 --> borderline
cholestrol > 240 --> risk





* bp levels

bp < 120 --> normal
between 120 and 140 --> borderline
bp > 140 --> risk





* fasting blood sugar

0  ( fbs < 120 )  --> normal
1  ( fbs > 120 )  --> high





* thalch ( highest heart rate achieved during exercise)

formula

thalch = 220 - age

85% and above --> good

less than 85% --> risk is based on how lower the thalch is ?





* rest ecg (resting electrocardiogram result)

0 --> no abnormalities

1 --> moderate risk ( not getting enough oxygen )

2 --> high risk ( heart failure & heart attack )





* exang ( exercise induced angina ) --> is exercise induces heart pain or discomfort

0 --> normal -- lower risk

1 --> high risk ( induces pain ) -- arteries may blocked






* oldpeak -- ST-segment depression in an ECG reading during exercise (stress test) compared to rest

0.0 --> normal ( no risk )

0.1 to 1.9 --> borderline ( signs of ischemia )  ( ischemia --> reduced blood flow )

above 2.0 --> high risk of heart attack






* slope -- describes the shape/angle of the ST segment during peak exercise in a stress test ECG

0 --> upsloping ( normal )

1 --> flat ( borderline )

2 --> downsloping ( high )




*  ca (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy)

ca = how many of the major coronary arteries (0–3) are visible/colored during fluoroscopy (an imaging technique with contrast dye).

This shows blockages in the heart’s major blood vessels.

(3 major coronary arteries )


0 --> no vessels blocked ( lower risk )

1 or 2 --> moderate risk

3 --> high risk







* thal ( how blood flows )


0 --> no risk

1 --> low risk

2 --> moderate risk

3 --> high risk



direct cause
|
|
|
|----High BP (trestbps)
|
|----High cholesterol (chol)
|
|----Diabetes (fbs)
|
|----Blocked vessels (ca)
|
|----Abnormal thal result (thal)




indirect cause
|
|
|
|----Chest pain (cp)
|
|----ECG results (restecg, oldpeak, slope)
|
|----Exercise response (thalach, exang)
